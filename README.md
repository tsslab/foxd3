## Project Description

The neural crest (NC) is a transient embryonic stem cell population characterised by its multipotency and broad developmental potential. 
We have performed NC-specific transcriptional and epigenomic profiling of foxd3-mutant versus wild type cells in vivo to define the gene regulatory circuits controlling NC specification. 
Together with global binding analysis obtained by foxd3 biotin-ChIP and single cell profiles of foxd3-expressing premigratory NC, our analysis shows that during early steps of NC formation, foxd3 acts globallyas a pioneer factor to prime the onset of genes regulating NC specification and migration by re-arranging the chromatin landscape, opening cis-regulatory elements and reshuffling nucleosomes. 
Strikingly, foxd3 then switches from an activator to its canonical role as a transcriptional repressor. 
Taken together, these results demonstrate that foxd3 acts bimodally in the neural crest as a switch from permissive to repressive nucleosome/chromatin organisation to maintain stemness and define cell fates.
